# Hang Man in python
This is a script I wrote that simulates a simple game of hangman. The user has a couple of tries to guess the right word before the man appears! For users wanting to play with more words, all you have to do is simply add more words to the dictionary file ( hangDict.py ) I have created. 

# Motivation
The inspiration behind making this program was really getting more familiar with the python language and how to utilize it's dynamic and fast data-structures to make something creative and fun. I really enjoyed creating this game and seeing the output all come together bit by bit.  


# Modules
- random
- hangDict.py

# Code style
- standard

# Sample output
||HANGMAN! SAVE THE MAN||
