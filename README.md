# Hang Man in python
One of my first programs I decided to develop in python. I wanted to learn the language in the summer of 2018 and I chose this game to be the project I test my skills on. Writing this script was a lot of fun and it showed me how powerful of a language python is overall. There are some minor bugs however when it comes to the letters being printed on the screen sometimes along with empty spaces. However, I beleive this script is one of my greatest programming acomplishments.
